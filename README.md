<h4>a scraper for facebook</h4>

<p>
This script is designed to scrape data from various facebook pages<br />
It looks for comments containing certain words and saves them to a file<br />
<br />
It takes 3 arguments:<br />
- the filename of the tagret word list<br />
- the filename of the target page list<br />
- the output path to dump the scraped data<br />
<br />
It is dependent on a file called "userapp.json" containing the App ID and App Secret in JSON format<br />
</p>
